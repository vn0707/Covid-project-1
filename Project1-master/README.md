Project1:
This is for our first project together
  The word document Project 1 Proposal was the original proposal for our project;

  Datasets:
    Dataset1, we have County_food_insecurity_2017.csv for county level food insecurity data;
    Dataset2, we have time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv for county level COVID19 infection data;
    Dataset3, we have time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv for county level COVID19 death data;
    Dataset4, we have df_cd19_mort_final.csv for merged data (in our codes) for final regression analyses as well as for maps;

  Codings:
      The jupyter notebook Project1_County_Food_COVID19_JZheng.jpynb is for clean the data for food insecurity and COVID19    data, and we included various new packages/modules to make the map interactive; we also inlcuded some statistical modules to conduct various regressions;
      The codes under the Heatmaps folder showed the process of generating goolge heatmaps;
      
  Results: 
    The pdf file actually showed all the output from the coding file Project1_County_Food_COVID19_JZheng.jpynb;
    The PPT file is our presentation slides;
    The google heatmaps (png files) are under the folder Heatmaps;
    The videos to show interactive maps is under Plotly_Maps.
